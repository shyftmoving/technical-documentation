Bugs detected on newly developed features are something we should be happy about because that is one less bug to crawl into production.  
The procedure, for fixing the bug on a new feature does not differ from work on an actual feature.

    - `YES` - Go to step 2.
    - `NO` - Ask for QA team member to create a bug ticket for you.
2. Proceed with [these steps](https://github.com/shyftmoving/technical-documentation/wiki/Working-on-a-new-feature).
