# Shyft Development Culture

Welcome to the collection of technical documents. These documents define a culture of software development in Shyft.  
Documents are mutually linked and easy to navigate  
You can read a specific topic, such as "Commit culture", or you can search for specific use case in [FAQ](FAQ) and navigate from there.  

Based on the role you have in the company, different set of articles applies to you. However, getting to know the whole process in tech team is encouraged.  

_This is an initial set of documents we have prepared, and there are many more to come. If you can't find something in the docs, please be patient and create an Issue for it, explaining what should be added and why.  
If you have a desire to write a document on your own, feel free to make a contribution. How to contribute is explained in the README._
