During our work on a new features, many things might be unspecified, late, or simply waiting for someone else to complete its part of the work.  
Whenever we are unable to continue our work on a feature, we are BLOCKED.  

It happens all the time. Design might be late, we're waiting for the API to complete, laptop broken, waiting for additional specification etc, etc.  
All these reasons are valid, but they won't wanish magically, therefore we have to be completely transparent over the situation and make it obvious to other team members, especially project lead, so that we unblock you as soon as possible.  

Here are the simple steps in this process.

1. Write down a comment on the ticket explaining what is blocking you.
2. Link the ticket that is blocking you by adding a "blocked by" link to related ticket.
3. Move the ticket to `BLOCKED` state.
4. As soon as the ticket is moved to `BLOCKED` state, the team will be notified via Slack notification.
5. Just in case someone skipped the notification, communicate the blocking situation with the project lead and team members.
