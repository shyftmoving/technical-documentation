So, you are working on a new feature and there are technical challenges you'd like to discuss with someone.  
It would be nice to have a comment-like collaboration and showing the code without screen sharing. Then, you need to use a draft pull request.  

A draft pull request is a Github feature, very handy for reviewing the work, while it's still in progress. 

1. Go to Github and create a draft pull request out of your `feature` or `hotfix` branch.
2. Assign reviewers and that's it. Now its up to you and your reviewers to discuss and figure out the best approach to the challenge.
3. Once you complete the implementation of the feature you are working on, go to Github and convert your draft pull request into the official pull request.
