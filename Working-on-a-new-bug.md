A new bug has been assigned to you and you are wondering, "What should I do.?"  

Let's start by recognizing what kind of bug it is.  
It is quite simple. It can be either a:
- Feature bug.
- Production bug.

## Feature bug
Ideally, most of our bugs should be feature bugs (non-production). That means that we have detected a bug during the ordinary development cycle.  
Check out [this document](Handling-feature-bugs) to see what are the necessary steps to start working on this type of bug.

## Production bug
Well, damn. Not much to say. Head over [here](Handling-production-bugs) and check the process of handling production bugs in detail.
