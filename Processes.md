# Processes

Here you can find the documents for different processes in Shyft.

## [BDD]()
We are relying on specifing a precise specification in form of Gherkin scenarios for our use cases during the product planning process. Later on, this specification is used by our dev team and eventually automated.

## [Working on a ticket]()
Are you a developer and starting to work on a new ticket? Pay attention to these steps.
